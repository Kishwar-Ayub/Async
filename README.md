As I'm not amongst experts but what according to me this article is about, will try my best to give a brief look.

# Summary of an article!
In the given article "Thomas Heartman" is creating a super simple application that fetches(to go and get) some Pokemon data and prints it to the console.
Before he got into his objective, he introduced some basic concept of Async Rust.
Async according to him, In Rust, running code concurrently or to run multiple computations on the same OS thread. Concuurent programming(asynchronous programming) is better for multi tasking when the task spends a lot of time waiting i.e., for a response from a server. These tasks are called I/O-bound.
.await is used when we need the result of async. computation and the values which are on waiting, called 'futures'.
Multithreading is perfect for CPU intensive tasks that can be use across different, multiple cores.
